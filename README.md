# OpenChassis

## The future home of OpenChassis

OpenChassis was inspired by [A-Chassis](https://www.roblox.com/library/1218274008/A-Chassis-6-72-T-by-Novena) and [SS6](https://www.roblox.com/library/759112322/SS6-Build-L025-SUSPENSION) plug and play car chassis systems primarily developed by [Inspare](https://www.roblox.com/groups/group.aspx?gid=730547). While both wildly successful in terms of use reach; signs of age are prevalent. OpenChassis desires to become a spiritual successor of the Inspare pair, with more focus on usability utilizing newer features of Roblox. 

## OpenChassis' Goals

To ensure usability of OpenChassis is as simple as possible while maintaining most extensive usability, the first focus of this repo is establishing supporting dependencies.

All contributions should use [LDoc](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc "LDoc's github repo").

Use of [Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/ "Busted's homepage"), or possibly [TestEZ](https://github.com/Roblox/testez "TestEZ's github repo") will be liberally employed for continuous integration and coverage with currently undecided services.

The goals of OpenChassis are to provide a scripter focused chassis system allowing for simple logic scripting to accomplish the majority of desired tasks. Simple examples providing for Seat triggered use will be included closer to OpenChassis' public facing release. Any internal system should be able to be replaced or disabled from a single top layer object per environment (server, client).
